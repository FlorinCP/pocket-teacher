## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Conjugate regular and irregular verbs in all past tenses
- Distinguish between preterite and imperfect usage
- Form and use compound past tenses
- Describe past events and situations appropriately
- Tell stories using multiple past tenses
- Express past habits and routines
- Discuss completed versus ongoing past actions

## Recommended Learning Path

The structure of this module follows a strategic progression:

1. Start with the preterite tense, as it deals with completed actions and has clear endpoints, making it conceptually simpler to grasp initially.

2. Move to the imperfect tense, which describes ongoing or habitual past actions. This provides a contrast to the preterite.

3. Study the distinction between preterite and imperfect extensively, as this is often the most challenging aspect for learners.

4. Learn the present perfect, which bridges present and past concepts and is used similarly to English.

5. Explore the past perfect, which helps express more complex sequences of events.

6. Finally, apply all these concepts to reflexive verbs, building on the knowledge from Module 1.
